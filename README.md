# ColourLerp, a color palette generation software

ColourLerp is a color interpolator using the HSV, L\*a\*b or HSP color space, quickly made using Godot 3.0, and it's useful for making color palettes, mainly for pixel art.

It contains a 32pxÂ² canvas. Clicking on the canvas places a pixel, and two pixels in the same line or column make a color-interpolated line.
